* The script submits an MSV/PSV and then validates whether the inserted specialty is correct.
* Environment --> Chrome browser

* Technologies:
 - Page Object Model Design Pattern
 - TestNg as a test framework and test runner
 - OOP concepts preserved 
 - Maven for managing dependencies
 
 
 * Future plan
 - Read the MSV/PSV data from an external source like an excel sheet.
 - Randomize the values used in the MSV/PSV each time a new MSV/PSV is submitted. 
 - Run the script on other browsers such as Firefox and Opera. 
 
 
 To run the script:
 1. Open the project on Eclipse or any other IDE for Java.
 2. Right Click on the project and hit "Update Project" to download the dependencies.
